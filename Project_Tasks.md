## Import data
- Import data from online CCFS database: set up remote connection with log-in credentials saved in gitignore file (GB)
- Import data from other sources (DW will document process in "external data update steps doc" and add csv files to "data" folder)
  - demographic data (such as https://www.bea.gov/resources/for-developers)
  - weather data (such as https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/)
  - environmental data (such as https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-data)
  
## Wrangle data for visualizations

## Create visualizations
Write code for the following figures:
1. Annual capture rate (y) by year (x) by species (group)
2. Phenology: Date of peak capture rate (y) by year (x) by species (group)
3. Map of net locations and animations of capture locations over time
4. Map of land use change categories with graph panel of bird abundance; can manipulate year to change both figures

## Create Shinyapp to bring visualizations online
